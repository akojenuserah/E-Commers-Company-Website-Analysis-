*Problem Statement:*
This project is about an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but also have an in-store style and clothing advice sessions.

The store allows customers come in to have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist,and then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is now trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
